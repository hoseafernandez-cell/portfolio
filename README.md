#### [Revenue Recovery & Lead Nurture System](link-to-repo)
* **The Problem:** High drop-off rates during the booking process and "cold" cart abandonment.
* **The Solution:** Built a multi-step nurture sequence in GoHighLevel that triggers when a prospect starts a booking but doesn't finish.
* **Key Logic:** Includes time-delay "Wait" steps, conditional branching based on lead tags, and automated "Hot Prospect" alerts for the sales team.
* **The Result:** Captured missed revenue by re-engaging prospects within the first 60 minutes of abandonment.
